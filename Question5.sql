-- Campaign 2 (Campaign2) seems to be the most effective campaign overall, according to the data presented. Here is why I think that:
--
-- It achieved respectable total impressions of 3238 while having the lowest total cost ($338.31).
-- The overall clicks to impressions ratio was a respectable 0.43, which indicates that clicks were generated from 43% of impressions.
-- Given the minimal expenditures, the overall revenue of $13415 was very impressive.
-- In conclusion, Campaign 2 had the lowest cost per acquisition while still generating sizable traffic and conversions. Based on the data we have it  appears to be significantly better than it was for the previous ads.
